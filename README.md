# Gas and Anomaly Detectors

## 0. Get the Dataset
To use the datset used in this project without having to download 20GB, follow this link to create a shortcut to the folder: 

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oc_4C5-dob3sHXk6yVxnxZ4JiaIx5HPx?usp=sharing

Click on the "IDMT_dataset" drop-down below the search bar in Drive and click: "Add shortcut to Drive". 

The folder should now be stored  in "My Drive". 






## 1. Preloading files
The second step is to extract information about each file based on the path to be able to group files based on environments, microphone, leak etc. 

Open the file: "file_information_retrivel.ipynb" by clicking the button below and follow the instructions to create a "wav_paths_master.csv" file that is needed later.
